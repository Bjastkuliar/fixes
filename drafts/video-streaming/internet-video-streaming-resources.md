## FFMpeg

> Fmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge. No matter if they were designed by some standards committee, the community or a corporation. - [ffmpeg about](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html)

* Has no GUI
* The project was started in 2000 by Fabrice Bellard
* The name is a concatenation of "FF" meaning "fast-forward" and MPEG, the name of a video standards group
