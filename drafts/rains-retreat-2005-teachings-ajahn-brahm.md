Wanting and striving is simply the urge to exchange one form of suffering or discontentment for another. The whole lot of suffering. What is the point of swapping one form of suffering for another? What do you do? You let go and give up - Ajahn Brahm

When you give up and stop striving and doing - you become still. Stillness grows in the lack of doing. It is the path out of samsara.

Whatever you do, wherever you do, you will have discontentment and suffering. It is universal.
The way is to stop moving and going.

The "Will" is the jailer of the prison.

Going out into the world to find happiness, content and peace is the completely opposite to what leads there. It is going within.

Thinking in itself is suffering and discontentment. 

Is the first noble truth 100% understood. Everything. All sensory experience is dukka.

Nibbida - repel from these things. Revulsion from being in prison.

Wiraga - fading away. If one fully understands the past and future are masses of suffering they can easily be let go. As easily as letting go of a hot coal in your hand - or a useless heavy weight on your back.

Do you truly understand the first noble truth?

Niroda - seeing suffering leads to the end of suffering. The end of the 6 senses. The end of the 5 sesnses. End of consiousness.
