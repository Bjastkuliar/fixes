## MySQL Groupwise Maximum

A common problem, it seems is getting the most recent field/record along with every parent or related record in a dataset.

### Most Recent Record

So let us break it down and do it just for the table containing the maximum's we want:

    SELECT
      user_id, MAX(created_at)
    FROM
      orders
    GROUP BY
      user_id

I tried this, but unfortunately I got an error from mysql:

    Lost connection to MySQL during query
