## Selling Cars: How to Sell Cars

> "Get the money, get ruthless!"

* In the job interview tell them you sold cars in the summer - 2 months.
    * How many opps you took (oppotunities) people who walk in - 50/70 opps a month
    * How many cars you sold? how many you wrote - penciling the figures
    * How many flakes - bad credit, no money down? Just get out of talking to these people
* know the demographic for the type of car you are selling
* Sell cars that will have resale value down the road, that have low maintenance
    * mazda
    * audi - maintenance nightmares
* Best dressed salesman - sells th most cars

> Hi, welcome to 120 cars, my name is Steve and you are? Name - Name, nice to meet you. Have you ever been to a 120 dealership before? Are you here to see anyone in particular? Wht do you want to achieve by visiting our dealership? Excellent.

* Break the ice without coming off too offensive - people are very offensive
* Play it off as a nice kid - don't be a swindler
* Smile all the time. When talking on the phone also smile because you will sound better.
* Gross is what you sell it for over invoice price. Anything over $3000 is 3 pounds.
* Tell the customer that is the price of the car - the lowest we can go - you win.
* Confidence in your price. Get them off the price of the car.
* Sell them on payment - interest rate, term. Get them a good deal on th payment term with deposit and they focus on that.
* Close 1 out of every 3 - if you don't you are weak
* It is all about moving units
* Hi how you doing - look at a few cars then bring them back to your desk
    * saving you time doftware to narrow down search
    * take their details and contact - better to use cell
    * remind them the big issue - it takes too long - tell them quick and painless
* On the test drive always keep talking - tell them about everything
* Open the passanger side - talk safety and service. Sit them in there, close the door and drive
* Buy it today...
* Get good at selling specific kinds of cars
* Tell them to park it in the sold line - play around - have they taken ownership
* Selling the car and sell yourself - I want to take care of you ensure it is easy
* Don't call it trading-in, they are selling us your car.
* Get model, year and milage
* If you can ask them to get something for you (they aren't being a prick) - they are starting up. You are in control. Keep control - ask them to do things, ask them if they want something to drink - do they want a coffee.

> If they are holding your pen - you lost control of the deal. 

* Listen to what your manager wants or says - godd managers have been in the business and make lots of money. Work with them - they are trying to make you money too.
* Put your hand over the price and talk about the payment
    * How close to this number can you come?
