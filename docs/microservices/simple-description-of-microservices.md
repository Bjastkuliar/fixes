title: Simple Description of Microservices
---

I came across a concise definition of microservices:

Microservices is an architectural style...

* Highly maintainable and testable
* Loosely coupled
* Independently deployable
* Organized around business capabilities
* Owned by a small team

> The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications.

> It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
