# Automation Wisdoms

* Automation starts with the workflow

> workflow - set of tasks strung together to achieve some meaningful business objective

* Don't reinvent the wheel
* Start simple and iterate

## Auto Remediation

* Reduce mean time to resolution (MTR)
* Avoid human error
* Positive team impact - avoid pager fatigue, capture operational knowledge as code, turn from reactive to pro-active

## Small Wins

* Do what you do everyday
* Improve one thing a time
* Don’t try to learn more than one thing at a time
* Start simple use cases

**Keep it simple**

## Building it from Scratch Yourself

> We’ve tried “the build and maintain it yourself” already and it’s a major failure. Let’s not burn out more time and people to go that wrong route. - [HFTGuy](https://thehftguy.com/2016/04/18/monitoring-in-the-cloud-datadog-vs-server-density-vs-stackdriver-vs-bmc-boundary-vs-newrelic/)
