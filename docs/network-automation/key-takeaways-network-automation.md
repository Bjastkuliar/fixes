# Key Takewaways from the Network Automation Journey at Netflix

* Don't reinvent the wheel
* Start simple and iterate
* Start with usecases with more pain and less control over the problem
* Pay special attention to the usability of your product
* Push for changing the culture
* Find sponsors for features - who will be more involved
* Implement best practices through a carefully designed interface instead of documentation
* Discourage anti-patterns - long term mitigation instead of fixing the root-cause
