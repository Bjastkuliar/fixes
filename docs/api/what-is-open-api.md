# What is OpenAPI?

## The OpenAPI Specification

It is a specification and initiative to create machine readable files to describe, produce, consume and visualize RESTful web services.

> Similar to what SOAP was done for years with it's WSDL's

Swagger provides a toolset to generate code (clients), test cases and documention.

The swagger specification is the ancestor of the OpenAPI specification

Swagger began development in early 2010.
The [OpenAPI Specification 3.0 was released in 2017](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)

Essentially it makes client and server communication easier by making it easy for client and server developers to communicate and stick to a consistent standard.

## What is open API (a.k.a Open "Space" API)

The concept that an API should be composed primarily of open source modules, open to inspection and utilisation.

## Benefits of OpenAPI

* Backed by serious players (used by VMWare)
* Implementation is stable - less likely to be abandoned
* The Swagger background - standing on the shoulders of giants
* Language Agnostic

Swagger provides:

* Swagger Editor
* Swagger UI
* Swagger Codegen
* Swagger Parser
* Swagger Core
* Swagger Inspector
* SwaggerHub

## Drawbacks

* It is a shortcut
* It stops the developer from implementing a schema centric design
