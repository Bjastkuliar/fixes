title: Ipv6 And Never Going Sub Slash 64
---
## Never go smaller than /64 when using IPv6

The best site to go to is [slash64.net](https://slash64.net/)

* Assignment to end sites: anything of length /64 or shorter works from a standards perspective.

### Email

Spam blacklists and DNS RBL will block on `/64`'s as per [Spamhaus ipv6 blocking](https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/Spamhaus%20CSS#426)
