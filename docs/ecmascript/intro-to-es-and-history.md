# Introduction to Ecmascript (Javascript)

Programming language and scripting language.

Intentionally limited, javascript only works within the context of a browser, a java script engine.
Doesn't have access to the filesystem and database.
Javascript not designed for input and output. It was designed to manipulate web pages.

Javascript is client side. It is sent to the clients computer and the client runs it locally on their computer.

Javascript although originally designed for the browser it is now in other applications and server side apps.
