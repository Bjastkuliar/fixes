## 1. What is Economics

Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses. - [Lionel Robbins](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Robbins.html)

What does “scarce” mean? It means that what everybody wants adds up to more than there is.

Not only scarcity but also “alternative uses” are at the heart of economics.

> Efficiency in production—the rate at which inputs are turned into output—is not just some technicality that economists talk about. It affects the life of whole societies.

It is not money but the volume of goods and services which determines whether a country is poverty stricken or prosperous.

## 2. The Role of Prices

Money to some people, for a society as a whole money is just an artificial device to get real things done

* feudal economy (central planning) - the lord of the manor directs / coordinates the operations and activities- same as soviet union
* market economy - prices coordinate the economy

> Consequences matter more than intentions

the simple mechanism of prices does the same job faster, cheaper, and better

Prices are like messengers conveying news

Prices are not just ways of transferring money. Their primary role is to provide incentives to affect behavior in the use of resources and their resulting products. Prices not only guide consumers, they guide producers as well.

Prices formed a worldwide web of communication long before there was an Internet

### Prices and Costs

Prices in a market economy are not simply numbers plucked out of the air or arbitrarily set by sellers. While you may put whatever price you wish on the goods or services that you provide, those prices will become economic realities only if others are willing to pay them and that depends not on whatever prices you have chosen but on what prices other producers charge for the same goods and services, and what prices the customers are willing to pay. Nothing to do with greed.

### Allocation of Resources

The price which one producer is willing to pay for any given ingredient becomes the price that other producers are forced to pay for that same ingredient

Resources tend to flow to their most valued uses when there is price competition in the marketplace.

> From the standpoint of society as a whole, the “cost” of anything is the value that it has in alternative uses.

The more government control, bureaucracy and central planning - the worse off the people are.

Losses are just as important as profits, from the standpoint of the economy. Losses stop losing companies and products from continuing and wasting resources.

### Supply, Demand and "Need"

* People tend to buy more at a lower price and less at a higher price
* people who produce goods or supply services tend to supply more at a higher price and less at a lower price
* The is no fixed "need" amount - defined by nation states. No fixed demand nor supply.

> The quantity supplied varies directly with price

If the price of oil falls - some low yielding oil wells are shut down.
If price rises or extraction becomes cheaper through new technologu - these oil wells return to operation.

> Many false predictions over the past century or more that we were “running out” of various natural resources in a few years were based on confusing the economically available current supply at current prices with the ultimate physical supply in the earth, which is vastly greater.

Price fluctuations are a way of letting a little knowledge go a long way. Price changes guide people’s decisions through trial and error adjustments to what other people can and will pay as consumers, as well as what others can and will supply as producers.

### Rationing by Prices

There are all kinds of prices:

* The prices of consumer goods
* The wages or salaries of labour
* The interest for borrowed money

> Prices provide incentives to conserve. (scarcity)

Any deal depends on both parties agreeing to the same terms

Competition is the crucial factor in explaining why prices usually cannot be maintained at arbitrarily set levels.

> Competition is the key to the operation of a price-coordinated economy. It not only forces prices toward equality, it likewise causes capital, labor, and other resources to flow toward where their rates of return are highest—that is, where the unsatisfied demand is greatest—until the returns are evened out through competition, much like water seeking its own level.

> However, the fact that water seeks its own level does not mean that the ocean has a glassy smooth surface. Waves and tides are among the ways in which water seeks its own level, without being frozen at that level. Similarly, in an economy, the fact that prices and rates of return on investments tend to equalize means only that their fluctuations, relative to one another, are what move resources from places where their earnings are lower to where their earnings are higher—that is, from where the supply is greatest, relative to the demand, to where there is the most unsatisfied demand. It does not mean that prices remain the same over time or that some ideal pattern of allocation of resources remains the same.

The **real** value - the usual level under usual conditions is no more _real or valid_ than their much higher or much lower levels under different conditions.

Change...impermanence...the price is lower because the context has changed

> The most fundamental reason why there is no such thing as an objective or “real” value is that there would be no rational basis for economic transactions if there were. When you pay 50 cents for a newspaper, obviously the only reason you do so is that the newspaper is more valuable to you than the 50 cents is.

**Voluntary human action**

At the same time, the only reason people are willing to sell the newspaper is that 50 cents is more valuable to them than the newspaper is.

> If there were any such thing as a “real” or objective value of a newspaper—or anything else—neither the buyer nor the seller would benefit from making a transaction at a price equal to that objective value, since what would be acquired would be of no greater value than what was given up. In that case, why bother to make the transaction in the first place?

On the other hand, if either the buyer or the seller was getting more than the objective value from the transaction, then the other one must be getting less—in which case, why would the other party continue making such transactions while being continually cheated?

> Unfairness to particular individuals is what makes the economy as a whole operate more efficiently for the benefit of vastly larger numbers of others - in the context of old world skills not wanted when new tech appears that can produce more efficiently and effectively

## 3. Price Controls

Nothing shows more vividly the role and importance of price fluctuations in a market economy than the absence of such price fluctuations when the market is controlled

A ceiling is set but so is a floor.

* Shortage - Prices rise because the amount demanded exceeds the amount supplied at existing prices.
* Surplus - Prices fall because the amount supplied exceeds the amount demanded at existing prices.

Rent controls on price kept prices low. The demand therefore increased but supply decreased.
No one was willing to supply or create more housing at the same low price.

> Just as price fluctuations allocate scarce resources which have alternative uses, price controls which limit those fluctuations reduce the incentives for individuals to limit their own use of scarce resources desired by others.

Landlords provide less maintenance and repair under rent control, since the housing shortage makes it unnecessary for them to maintain the appearance of their premises in order to attract tenants.

Many buildings have been abandoned after their owners found it impossible to collect enough rent to cover the costs of services that they are required by law to provide, such as heat and hot water.

> Politicians know that there are always more tenants than landlords and more people who do not understand economics than people who do.

Often it is politically effective to represent rent control as a way to keep greedy rich landlords from “gouging” the poor with “unconscionable” rents. In reality, rates of return on investments in housing are seldom higher than on alternative investments and landlords are often people of very modest means.

> Rising prices not only allocate existing housing, they provide incentives for rebuilding and for renters to use less space in the meantime, as well as incentives for those with space in their homes to take in roomers while rents are high.

Price movements allow for goods to move to different regions: In a free market, supply and demand would cause prices to rise where goods are in short supply and fall where they are abundant, providing incentives to move things from regions where there is a surplus to regions where there is a shortage.

> No doubt many or most of the motorists whose daily lives and work were disrupted by having to spend hours driving around looking for a filling station with gas, or waiting in line behind other cars when they found one, would gladly have paid a few cents more per gallon of gasoline, in order to avoid such problems and stresses.

Hoarding - Due to a gas shortage - anyone with half a tank of gas would fill up when they saw an open gas station. Therefore exacerbating the relatively small problem.

> Price controls almost invariably produce black markets, where prices are not only higher than the legally permitted prices, but also higher than they would be in a free market, since the legal risks must also be compensated.

Price buts are greeted favourably from consumers however when producers stop selling due to no profit to be made - only a loss - consumers have no products and services to purchase. Mugabe thinking...

An apple is not easy to define because apples differ in size, freshness, and appearance, quite aside from the different varieties of apples. Under price control, however, the amount of apples demanded at an artificially low price exceeds the amount supplied, so there is no need to spend so much time and money sorting out apples, as they will all be sold anyway.

Under Britain’s government-controlled medical system, a twelve-year-old girl was given a breast implant while 10,000 people waited 15 months or more for surgery.
Prices cause individuals to consider priorities -

> But life does not ask us what we want. It presents us with options. Economics is one of the ways of trying to make the most of those options.


> Without the role of prices, imagine what a monumental bureaucracy it would take to see to it that the city of London alone is supplied with the tons of food, of every variety, which it consumes every day

> Even if the government were to decree that beach-front homes were a “basic right” of all members of society, that would still not change the underlying scarcity in the slightest.

> Prices not only guide consumers, they guide producers as well

> Markets coordinated by price movements - capitalism, as it is called - is the natural way of things

> Although a free market economic system is sometimes called a profit system, it is in reality a profit-and-loss system—and the losses are equally important for the efficiency of the economy, because losses tell producers what to stop doing—what to stop producing, where to stop putting resources, what to stop investing in.

> "Losses force the producers to stop producing what consumers don’t want” - they don't even have to know why.

> The staggering number of economic transactions, on ever-changing terms as supply and demand vary almost continuously, is beyond the knowledge and capacity of any individual or any manageable-sized group of planners to direct in any economy, much less in the world market

> The significance of free market prices in the allocation of resources can be seen more clearly by looking at situations where prices are not allowed to perform this function

> While telling people what to do might seem to be a more rational or orderly way of coordinating an economy, it has turned out to be far less effective in practice. 

> The sight of aisle after aisle of shelves neatly stacked with every conceivable type of foodstuff and household item, each in a dozen varieties, both amazed and depressed him. For Yeltsin, like many other first-time Russian visitors to America, this was infinitely more impressive than tourist attractions like the Statue of Liberty and the Lincoln Memorial

> The market is cordinated by prices - automatically. Human intervention is only required at the most basic level raising and lower you bid and ask prices.
