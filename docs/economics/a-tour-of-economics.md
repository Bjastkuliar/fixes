### Says Law

Jean-Baptiste Say's 1803 book, Treatise on Political Economy.

> The income generated by past production and sale of goods is the source of spending that creates demand to purchase current production

The buyer must first have produced something - it is not money itself that is the source. Merely handing out money is not good as nothing has been produced.

### Theory of Revealed Preference

Paul Anthony Samuelson in 1938.

States that consumer behavior is the best indicator of their preferences - not what they say.

It can be broadened to anything. Do not beleive what anyone says - verify by observing what they do.
