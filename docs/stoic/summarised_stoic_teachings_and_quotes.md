### The Backwards Law - Stop Trying to get it and you will get it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O42tZse-P6w

* It is difficult to get rid of a thought by force
* Dissatisfaction from life with negative emotions - the more you try be less dissatisfied the more dissatisfied you become
* Trying to be happy - trying to be content - is exactly the reason you aren't
* Willpower and effort is something useful in the external world - getting money, improving fitness
* What is happiness? Is it something we acquire from material things or love. 
* Alan Watts: 1. you don't know what you want, you never can 2. you have it
* Fire doesn't burn itself, a knife cannot cut itself
* The human predicament is a delusion stating that changing external things and circumstances: objects, money, adjustments of the body and changes of scenery. The backwards law tells us the opposite is the case.
* Pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it
* The will to live
* The mind perceives that the present moment is not enough - we try to escape what is into situations perceived as more pleasurable. Thus ever keen pleasure is an error and an illusion for no attained wish can give lasting satisfaction - Arthur Schopenhauer
* Negation of the will
* Accept - do not fight. If you fight you suffer twice.
* When trying to fall asleep - forcing yourself makes it harder - only when you stop trying does it work.
* Life is not a problem to be solved - but a reality to be experienced

## Alan Watts - Meditation and Stop Talking to Yourself

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVCHP4rNUQ0

Mediation - shut up - be interiorly silent.
Cease from the internal chatter in our skulls - we think compulsively.

If you are thinking all the time (talking to yourself) - you do not hear what anyone else has to say.
You are not in a relationship with reality.

The purpose of music is not to get to the end - there is no destination.
The journey itself is the reason.
Mediation is the reason - the point of life is in the immediate moment.
If you are looking to improve - you have your eye on the future.
An eternal now.
It must be fun.

Death is going to sleep and never waking up.
The ego is a designed function of the brain - a radar looking for problems but finding yourself.
Your organism is part of everything else - you are shining the sun.
