I have managed to solve most of the problems in my career using relational databases.
However I have read that there are a few advantages of NoSQL over a relational DB.

Let us see what these NoSQL dbs can do

### NoSQL Options

I just did a quick search for options (and I am not using services from public cloud providers).
I will use the age old popularity contest of github stars to choose:

* [apache couchdb](https://github.com/apache/couchdb): 5.4k stars
* [apache cassandra](https://github.com/apache/cassandra): 7.4k stars
* [mongodb](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo): 22k stars
* [apache hbase](https://github.com/apache/hbase): 4.6k stars

Wow, 3 [apache foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation) projects.

They have [26 Database projects in total](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?category#database).

I am going with popularity: [`mongodb`](./mongodb.md)
