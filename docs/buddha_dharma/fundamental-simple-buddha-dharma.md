## Core Fundamental Teachings of Buddha

* The history of buddhism and the buddha himself isn't essential
* The esotheric, extensive detail, rites, rituals and the number of things are inconesquential
* The worshipping and blind belief as buddha as a god is also false. He was a human and we are humans.
* Do not blindly delieve. Independently verify through observation.
* This is not a religion - with rites, rituals, ceremony and worship
* The mind is not the brain - it is intangible
* The problem is craving, desire and attachment. The longing with strong eagerness (craving) - causes the mind to be discontent: sadness, anger, frustration, irritation, annoyance, guilt, shame, fear, boredom, lonliness, shyness, jealousy, resentment, stress, anxiety and many others.
* To attain a mind that resides permanently peaceful, calm, serene, and content with joy - you need to establish a life practice
* Meditation and teachers and guides.
* dedicated to improving our own wisdom, moral conduct, and mental discipline that we will improve the world
* gradual training and gradual practice to experience gradual progress
* We can choose to be peaceful, kind, loving, and warm. We can choose to have wholesome interactions with all people. We can develop healthy qualities of the mind with loving-kindness, compassion, generosity along with other qualities that will produce a peaceful and content mind.

> There are no rites, rituals, ceremonies, and worship required to attain Enlightenment. If someone explains certain chants that need to be repeated, certain postures the body needs to be trained to acquire, or sells/provides you any external devices that includes bells, strings, clothing, beads, music, statues, special drinks or food, etc. then this person has not attained Enlightenment.

### The Three Universal Truths

1. Impermanence (Pāli: anicca)
2. Discontentedness (Pāli: dukkha)
3. Non-Self (Pāli: anattā)

> Oftentimes, the mind wants everyone to understand you and attempts to convince others of something. This is not accomplishable as not everyone is going to understand you because that would be permanence.

> Not everyone is going to agree with your opinions and views. There are going to be some people who agree with you and others who disagree.

> Happiness is impermanent

The unenlightened mind has feelings based on impermanent conditions - leading to discontentedness and suffering.

The teachings allow you to find a mental state in the middle.

> Discontentedness describes the mental state when the mind is unsatisfied, displeased, uncalm, or unpeaceful. The mind is shaken up, unsteady, or unstable.

> There is no permanent self

> The misunderstanding that the mind has thinking there is a permanent self leads to the mind continuously wanting to protect the self image and self identity being unable to remain peaceful and calm when there is a disagreeable experience related to the self image or self identity.

For example, if someone comments about the self image or self identity in a way that the mind agrees with, the mind can experience pleasant feelings. But, if someone comments about the self image or self identity in a way that the mind disagrees with, the mind can experience painful feelings.

> When the mind holds on to a permanent self, one can oftentimes become very selfish, self centered, self absorbed, and pursue its own selfish desires. This inhibits a person from being able to observe the life changing wisdom that we are all interconnected and need to improve the way we function in the world through giving and sharing living harmoniously with each other.

Your given name is just a label.

> The mind is searching and yearning to discover a self but it can never find one though it continues its pursuit seeking to know and find a self because the mind does not realize there isn’t one.



### The Four Noble truths

Impermanence: Everything is constantly changing and there is no permanent state. Material objects/possessions, relationships, thoughts, ideas, states of mind, everything in the world is constantly changing. All conditioned feelings will cease to exist. All that arises will cease to exist. There is no steady, constant, or fixed mental state other than Enlightenment.

1. First Noble Truth: Everyone that is unEnlightened will experience discontentedness.
2. Second Noble Truth: Discontentedness is caused by our own cravings/desires/attachments because the mind wants everything to be permanent when everything in the world is impermanent.
3. Third Noble Truth: The elimination of discontentedness is possible by eliminating cravings/desires/attachments.
4. Fourth Noble Truth: The path to eliminating discontentedness is The Eight Fold Path.

> The goal in life is not to be happy, as that is an impermanent feeling. When the mind is not happy, it will move to sadness, anger, or worse.

The goal in life is to develop a peaceful, calm, serene, and content mind with joy free of cravings/desires/attachments that is “satisfied with what is… - the Enlightened mind.

> You need to accept responsibility for your own discontent mind and the emotions you experience. Rather than blaming pleasant feelings, painful feelings, and feelings that are neither painful-nor-pleasant on someone or something external, see the truth that you cause your own discontent mind.

### 3 Universal Teachings

1. Universal Love for all Beings
2. Do not harm
3. Be a good moral person

Gotama Buddha’s goal was to provide Teachings that gave the mind a place where it could be permanently peaceful, calm, serene, and content with joy.

Everything in this practice is obtained through personal choice.

unaffected by everyday challenges that produce sadness, worry, anger, stress, anxiety, and other discontent feelings

Happiness is impermanent - craving happiness is the reason we are not achieving lasting happiness
