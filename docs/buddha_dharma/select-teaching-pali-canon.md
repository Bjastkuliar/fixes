## Teachings from the Pali Canon

> A selection of teachings that resonated...

### an2.34 - Action and Inaction

Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
“What does Master Gotama teach? What does he explain?”
“Brahmin, I teach action and inaction.”
“But in what way does Master Gotama teach action and inaction?”
“I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things.
I teach action regarding good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of skillful things.
This is the kind of action and inaction that I teach.”
“Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

### an10.170 - The near shore and the far shore

The Near Shore
“Mendicants, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak. …
And what, mendicants, is the near shore? What is the far shore?
Killing living creatures is the near shore, mendicants, and not killing living creatures is the far shore.
Stealing is the near shore, and not stealing is the far shore.
Sexual misconduct is the near shore, and avoiding sexual misconduct is the far shore.
Lying is the near shore, and not lying is the far shore.
Divisive speech is the near shore, and avoiding divisive speech is the far shore.
Harsh speech is the near shore, and avoiding harsh speech is the far shore.
Talking nonsense is the near shore, and avoiding talking nonsense is the far shore.
Covetousness is the near shore, and contentment is the far shore.
Ill will is the near shore, and good will is the far shore.
Wrong view is the near shore, and right view is the far shore.
This is the near shore, and this is the far shore.
Few are those among humans
who cross to the far shore.
The rest just run
around on the near shore.
When the teaching is well explained,
those who practice accordingly
are the ones who will cross over
Death’s domain so hard to pass.
Rid of dark qualities,
an astute person should develop the bright.
Leaving home behind
for the seclusion so hard to enjoy,
you should try to find delight there,
having left behind sensual pleasures.
With no possessions, an astute person
should cleanse themselves of mental corruptions.
And those whose minds are rightly developed
in the awakening factors;
letting go of attachments,
they delight in not grasping.
With defilements ended, brilliant,
they are extinguished in this world.” 

## sn18.8 - Craving 

At Sāvatthī.
“What do you think, Rāhula?
Is craving for sights permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“… craving for sounds …
craving for smells …
craving for tastes …
craving for touches …
Is craving for thoughts permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. …” 

## an9.66 - Grasping Aggregates

“Mendicants, there are these five grasping aggregates.
What five?
The grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
These are the five grasping aggregates.
To give up these five grasping aggregates you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. …”

## sn54.14

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
“Ānanda, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things; and those four things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seven things; and those seven things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill two things?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …”
“There is, Ānanda.
And what is that one thing?
Immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. And the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors. And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom.
And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? …

That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” 

## Perception

At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, perception of sights is impermanent, perishing, and changing.
Perception of sounds,
perception of smells,
perception of tastes,
perception of touches,
and perception of thoughts are impermanent, perishing, and changing.
Someone who has faith and confidence in these principles is called a follower by faith. …” 

## sn45.162 - Discriminations

“Mendicants, there are three kinds of discrimination.
What three?
One discriminates, thinking that ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’.
These are the three kinds of discrimination.
The noble eightfold path should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these three kinds of discrimination.
What is the noble eightfold path?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
This is the noble eightfold path that should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these three kinds of discrimination.”

## an1.59 - Deligence

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to skillful qualities, or makes unskillful qualities decline like diligence.
When you’re diligent, skillful qualities arise and unskillful qualities decline.” 


## sn35.85 - The World is Empty

And then Venerable Ānanda … said to the Buddha:
“Sir, they say that ‘the world is empty’.
What does the saying ‘the world is empty’ refer to?”
“Ānanda, they say that ‘the world is empty’ because it’s empty of self or what belongs to self.
And what is empty of self or what belongs to self?
The eye,
sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact are empty of self or what belongs to self. …
The pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact is also empty of self or what belongs to self.
They say that ‘the world is empty’ because it’s empty of self or what belongs to self.” 

## an4.157 - Illness

Mendicants, there are two kinds of illness.
What two?
Mental and physical.
Some sentient beings are seen who can claim to be free of physical illness for a year, or two, or three years … even up to a hundred years or more.
But it’s very hard to find any sentient beings in the world who can claim to be free of mental illness even for a moment, apart from those who have ended the defilements.
There are four kinds of illness for those gone forth.
What four?
To start with, a mendicant has many wishes, is frustrated, and is not content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
Because of this, they focus their corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity.
They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things.
They have an ulterior motive when they visit families. They have an ulterior motive when they sit down, when they speak on Dhamma, and even when they hold it in when they need to go to the toilet.
These are the four kinds of illness for those gone forth.
So you should train like this:
‘We will not have many wishes or be frustrated. We will be content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. We won’t focus our corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity. We won’t try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things. We will endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. We will endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. We will endure rude and unwelcome criticism. We will put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.’
That’s how you should train.

### sn35.62 - The Depletion of All Fuel (2nd)

“Mendicants, I will teach you the principle for depleting all fuel.
Listen …
And what is the principle for depleting all fuel?
What do you think, mendicants?
Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Sights …
eye consciousness …

eye contact …

The pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact: is that permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“Ear …
nose …
tongue …
body …
mind …
thoughts …
mind consciousness …
mind contact …
The pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact: is that permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact.
And they grow disillusioned with the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact.
They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body …
They grow disillusioned with the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact.
And they grow disillusioned with the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
This is the principle for depleting all fuel.” 

## mn10 - Mindfulness Meditation

So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
What four?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

1. Observing the Body
1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there.
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.
When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’
They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body.
They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion.
It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’



And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.

1.2. The Postures
Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’
Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.

1.3. Situational Awareness
Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.

1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive
Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.
‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’
It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’


And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.

1.5. Focusing on the Elements
Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:
‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’
It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.


And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.

1.6. The Charnel Ground Contemplations
Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’

That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’

That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …
A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …
A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …
Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull …




White bones, the color of shells …
Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile …
Bones rotted and crumbled to powder.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.


2. Observing the Feelings
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of feelings?
It’s when a mendicant who feels a pleasant feeling knows: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’
When they feel a painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’
When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling.’
When they feel a material pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material pleasant feeling.’
When they feel a spiritual pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual pleasant feeling.’
When they feel a material painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material painful feeling.’
When they feel a spiritual painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual painful feeling.’
When they feel a material neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material neutral feeling.’
When they feel a spiritual neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual neutral feeling.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the feelings internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing feelings as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that feelings exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings.

3. Observing the Mind
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the mind?
It’s when a mendicant understands mind with greed as ‘mind with greed,’
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed.’
They understand mind with hate as ‘mind with hate,’
and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate.’
They understand mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion,’
and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion.’
They know constricted mind as ‘constricted mind,’
and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind.’
They know expansive mind as ‘expansive mind,’
and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind.’
They know mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme,’
and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme.’
They know mind immersed in samādhi as ‘mind immersed in samādhi,’
and mind not immersed in samādhi as ‘mind not immersed in samādhi.’
They know freed mind as ‘freed mind,’
and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the mind as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that the mind exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the mind.
