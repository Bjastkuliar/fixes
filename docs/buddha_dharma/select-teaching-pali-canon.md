> A selection of teachings that resonated...

### an2.34 - Action and Inaction

Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
“What does Master Gotama teach? What does he explain?”
“Brahmin, I teach action and inaction.”
“But in what way does Master Gotama teach action and inaction?”
“I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things.
I teach action regarding good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of skillful things.
This is the kind of action and inaction that I teach.”
“Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

### an10.170 - The near shore and the far shore

The Near Shore
“Mendicants, I will teach you the near shore and the far shore.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak. …
And what, mendicants, is the near shore? What is the far shore?
Killing living creatures is the near shore, mendicants, and not killing living creatures is the far shore.
Stealing is the near shore, and not stealing is the far shore.
Sexual misconduct is the near shore, and avoiding sexual misconduct is the far shore.
Lying is the near shore, and not lying is the far shore.
Divisive speech is the near shore, and avoiding divisive speech is the far shore.
Harsh speech is the near shore, and avoiding harsh speech is the far shore.
Talking nonsense is the near shore, and avoiding talking nonsense is the far shore.
Covetousness is the near shore, and contentment is the far shore.
Ill will is the near shore, and good will is the far shore.
Wrong view is the near shore, and right view is the far shore.
This is the near shore, and this is the far shore.
Few are those among humans
who cross to the far shore.
The rest just run
around on the near shore.
When the teaching is well explained,
those who practice accordingly
are the ones who will cross over
Death’s domain so hard to pass.
Rid of dark qualities,
an astute person should develop the bright.
Leaving home behind
for the seclusion so hard to enjoy,
you should try to find delight there,
having left behind sensual pleasures.
With no possessions, an astute person
should cleanse themselves of mental corruptions.
And those whose minds are rightly developed
in the awakening factors;
letting go of attachments,
they delight in not grasping.
With defilements ended, brilliant,
they are extinguished in this world.” 

## sn18.8 - Craving 

At Sāvatthī.
“What do you think, Rāhula?
Is craving for sights permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“… craving for sounds …
craving for smells …
craving for tastes …
craving for touches …
Is craving for thoughts permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. …” 

## an9.66 - Grasping Aggregates

“Mendicants, there are these five grasping aggregates.
What five?
The grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
These are the five grasping aggregates.
To give up these five grasping aggregates you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. …”

## sn54.14

Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
“Ānanda, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things; and those four things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seven things; and those seven things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill two things?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …”
“There is, Ānanda.
And what is that one thing?
Immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. And the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors. And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom.
And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? …

That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” 

## Perception

At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, perception of sights is impermanent, perishing, and changing.
Perception of sounds,
perception of smells,
perception of tastes,
perception of touches,
and perception of thoughts are impermanent, perishing, and changing.
Someone who has faith and confidence in these principles is called a follower by faith. …” 

## sn45.162 - Discriminations

“Mendicants, there are three kinds of discrimination.
What three?
One discriminates, thinking that ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’.
These are the three kinds of discrimination.
The noble eightfold path should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these three kinds of discrimination.
What is the noble eightfold path?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
This is the noble eightfold path that should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these three kinds of discrimination.”

## an1.59 - Deligence

“Mendicants, I do not see a single thing that gives rise to skillful qualities, or makes unskillful qualities decline like diligence.
When you’re diligent, skillful qualities arise and unskillful qualities decline.” 

## an225–229

“When they have two things, some people — when their body breaks up, after death—are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
What two?
Freedom from anger and hostility … freedom from disdain and contempt … freedom from jealousy and stinginess … freedom from deceit and deviousness … conscience and prudence.
When they have these two things, some people—when their body breaks up, after death—are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

## sn35.85 - The World is Empty

And then Venerable Ānanda … said to the Buddha:
“Sir, they say that ‘the world is empty’.
What does the saying ‘the world is empty’ refer to?”
“Ānanda, they say that ‘the world is empty’ because it’s empty of self or what belongs to self.
And what is empty of self or what belongs to self?
The eye,
sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact are empty of self or what belongs to self. …
The pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact is also empty of self or what belongs to self.
They say that ‘the world is empty’ because it’s empty of self or what belongs to self.” 

## an4.157 - Illness

Mendicants, there are two kinds of illness.
What two?
Mental and physical.
Some sentient beings are seen who can claim to be free of physical illness for a year, or two, or three years … even up to a hundred years or more.
But it’s very hard to find any sentient beings in the world who can claim to be free of mental illness even for a moment, apart from those who have ended the defilements.
There are four kinds of illness for those gone forth.
What four?
To start with, a mendicant has many wishes, is frustrated, and is not content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
Because of this, they focus their corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity.
They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things.
They have an ulterior motive when they visit families. They have an ulterior motive when they sit down, when they speak on Dhamma, and even when they hold it in when they need to go to the toilet.
These are the four kinds of illness for those gone forth.
So you should train like this:
‘We will not have many wishes or be frustrated. We will be content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. We won’t focus our corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity. We won’t try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things. We will endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. We will endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. We will endure rude and unwelcome criticism. We will put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.’
That’s how you should train.
