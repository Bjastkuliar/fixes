    * Right action: abstinence from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
    * Right livelihood: avoiding any means of livelihood that involves harm or exploitation of others.

    * Right endeavour (right restraint): Do not fight the monster - use loving kindness, do not have strong eagerness (not effort), let go of the will, training the mind to avoid unwholesome mental states and to develop wholesome mental states.
    * Right mindfulness: developing the power of attentiveness and awareness in regard to the "four foundations of mindfulness" — body, feelings, mind, and mental phenomena.
    * Right concentration (right stillness): cultivation of one-pointedness of mind.
