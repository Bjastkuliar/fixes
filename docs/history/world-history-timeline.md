## The Lessons of History

> The influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows.

* The first biological lesson of history is that life is competition
* The second biological lesson of history is that life is selection
* The third biological lesson of history is that life must breed

> Nature has no use for organisms, variations, or groups that cannot reproduce abundantly

> Ideally parentage should be a privilege of health, not a by-product of sexual agitation.

Freedom and inequality are the realities.

Utopias of equality are biologically doomed

> Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes, and Normans fused to produce Englishmen

> Means and instrumentalities change; motives and ends remain the same: to act or rest, to acquire or give, to fight or retreat, to seek association or privacy, to mate or reject, to offer or resent parental care.

> A youth boiling with hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires; and if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws, he may ruin his life before he matures sufficiently to understand that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group

During agricultural time period: So he married early, almost as soon as nature wished; he did not fret long under the restraints placed upon premarital relations by the new order of permanent settlements and homes. As for young women, chastity was indispensable, for its loss might bring unprotected motherhood.

Industrial revolution: Men, women, and children left home and family, authority and unity, to work as individuals, individually paid, in factories built to house not men but machines.

> when religion declines Communism grows

> Then the replacement of agriculture—which had stirred men to faith by the annual rebirth of life and the mystery of growth—with industry, humming daily a litany of machines, and suggesting a world machine.

> Buddha created a religion without a god. When he died, people made him the god - opposing his teachings.

> The men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all

It is the minds of peasants and serfs that short sightedly longs for communism

> Since men love freedom, and the freedom of individuals in society requires some regulation of conduct, the first condition of freedom is its limitation; make it absolute and it dies in chaos

> Power naturally converges to a center, for it is ineffective when divided, diluted, and spread - expet for bitcoin power increases when spread

> Since wealth is an order and procedure of production and exchange rather than an accumulation of (mostly perishable) goods, and is a trust (the “credit system”) in men and institutions rather than in the intrinsic value of paper money or checks, violent revolutions do not so much redistribute wealth as destroy it

> The only real revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real emancipation is individual, and the only real revolutionists are philosophers and saints

> And while rural isolation enhanced the freedom of the individual, national isolation provided liberty and security within protective seas

> Personal isolation is gone through the growth of cities. Personal independence is gone through the dependence of the worker upon tools and capital that he does not own, and upon conditions that he cannot control.

> Education has spread, but intelligence is perpetually retarded by the fertility of the simple

> The causes of war are the same as the causes of competition among individuals: acquisitiveness, pugnacity, and pride; the desire for food, land, materials, fuels, mastery.

> The individual submits to restraints laid upon him by morals and laws, and agrees to replace combat with conference, because the state guarantees him basic protection in his life, property, and legal rights.

> On one point all are agreed: civilizations begin, flourish, decline, and disappear—or linger on as stagnant pools left by once life-giving streams.

> Life has no inherent claim to eternity, whether in individuals or in states. Death is natural, and if it comes in due time it is forgivable and useful, and the mature mind will take no offense from its coming
