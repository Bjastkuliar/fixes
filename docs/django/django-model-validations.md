# Django Model Validations

Something to keep in mind when validating on the model is that the `clean` method is not called automatically.

So you have to override the `save` method so that the validation is done. Otherwise only `IntegrityError`s are raised.

### Code

Add the following method to your model

        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.full_clean()
            return super().save(*args, **kwargs)

### Model Validations do not run on model level

These validations will fire when creating objects with a `ModelForm` but they will not if you are just creating the object directly.

    full_time_equivalent = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=5,
        decimal_places=2,
        default=100,
        validators=[
            MinValueValidator(Decimal(0)),
            MaxValueValidator(Decimal(100))
        ]
    )

So it is again as above you need to run the `self.full_clean()` method on `save()`
