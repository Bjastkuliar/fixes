# Using the Django Shell

The django shell is similar to the python shell and lets you test out pieces of code in the interpreter.

The django shell just loads django and all your models and settings as well.

#### Opening the shell

    python manage.py shell

#### Working with models

Import the model

    from app.models import Modelname

Get all records

    ModelName.objects.all()

This returns an empty queryset: `[]`

It looks like a list but is really a queryset

    type(ModelName.objects.all())

Create a new Model

    # Create model and set fields
    m = ModelName()
    m.title = "Setting Title"
    m.description = "The Description"
    m.save()

Can also be done in a single step

    ModelName(title="Setting Title", description="The Description").save()

But you can do this in a single step and return the saved instance (object)

    m = ModelName.objects.create(title="Set Another Title", description="hello")
